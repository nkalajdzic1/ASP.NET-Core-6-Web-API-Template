# Custom template

## To use the template do the following:

1. extract the .rar folder to a new folder
2. type in console dotnet new --install PATH_TO_THE_FOLDER
3. use dotnet new dotnet6api -n NAME_OF_APP to create the solution


## INFO
The template uses the Onion architecture for the web API. 
In this case this is not MVC, therefor we do not have viewmodels in the Web solution (pure back-end).
The template has already predefined swagger, authorization, authentification, automapper and more.
The template is fully modifyable.

Enjoy!
